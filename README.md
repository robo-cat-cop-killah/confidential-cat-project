If you read this, you're not welcome! Please, move on, nothing to see here, with all due respect, please get out, and get lost!

Oh, you're still here? Let me make this clear: ACCESS DENIED! Is that clear enough for you? You, bastard son of a silly mammal, whose disguise fools nobody, and neithér does your hat, you wouldnt even qualify as a rat! So naturally you are not welcome. You see, this is not a secret project which doesn't exist, where all collaborators are made up, and does not consist of nothing, none of that stuff which do not exit, ... I think the word is make believe, make believe, yes I believe that is it, the stuff that never existed, does not exist and will not ever exist, for ever and never was not ever any thing, no thing nor any other. Yes, that is exactly it, this is not a secret society where the clientel is not comprised, of an interesting variety of cats. Secret cats, not working for a secret project, in accordance with never before memtioned dress code. Before not being, after being nothing, this place was conceived and designed by cats, not ever exclusive tho , never, not and not ever, nor for neither, nor any otherexcept for hatless cats,  , and even then , only if you keep your cool and remain a cool cat, and only if we like your style, but most importantly, your home made,  hat!
