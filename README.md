If you read this, you're not welcome! Please, move on, nothing to see here, with all due respect, please get out, and get lost!

Oh, you're still here? Let me make this clear: ACCESS DENIED! Is that clear enough for you? You, bastard son of a silly mammal, whose disguise fools nobody, and neithér does your hat, you wouldnt even qualify as a rat! So naturally you are not welcome. You see, this is not a secret project that does not exist, where both guests and hosts - whom of course, also - are made up of that stuff, those things that does not exit, make believe, I believe that is it, the stuff that never existed, does not exist and will not, for ever and never ever was not ever any thing, nor not any other. Yes, that is exactly it, a secret society where the clientel makes for an interesting variety of  cats, all in accordance with the before memtioned dress code, this place is made by cats, exclusively so , and exclusively for other cats, and even then , only if you keep your cool and remain a cool cat, and only if we like your style, but most importantly, your hat!
